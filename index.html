                    <h1>BIG heading</h1>
            <section>I am a junior working on a bachelor of science in Computer Science with just a general emphasis.</section>
                    <h2>Small heading</h2>
            <section>I am from St. Louis. My hobbies are very varied from learning more about topics in computer science to the very average hobby of playing video games. Story-based games are the best. I have tried to get into building models for a hobby but that requires much more patience then I have.</section>
                    <h3>Smaller Heading</h3>
           <section> For my plans, after school, I want to try a bunch of things before I settle. I want to try software development, database administration and data science. I just wanna try everything before I commit myself to a job because something else could have been a better fit.</section>
                    <h4>Smallest heading</h4>
            <section>An interesting thing about me is over the winter I build a model of Notre Dame. Which does look half bad considering I got frustrated and started to use tape.</section>
